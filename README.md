Project/Goals:
The tasks are as follows:

1- Explore the structure of the API, query the API and understand the data returned. This is a link to google for the API cityBikes website http://api.citybik.es/v2/

2- Choose a city covered by the CityBikes API and retrieve all available bike stations in that city.

3- For each bike station, use the API to call the latitude, longitude and number of bikes.

4- Parse the JSON object into a Pandas dataframe.

What is citybikes? Citybikes is an API that provides bike sharing data for apps, research and projects. And supports more than 400 cities.

Process
I performed this project by two methods. First: calling using requests library Second: calling using CityBike library Both methods have different techniques to fetching data and to export json files.

Challenges
Reading nested dictionary from json file, flaten, and converting to csv
